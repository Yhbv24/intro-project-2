          <h3>We're glad you chose Epicodus to learn how to program. While we offer numerous tracks, the languages themselves aren't as important as the <em>concepts</em> behind them. We hope that you focus on how to <em>learn</em>, rather than the languages themselves. Please have a look <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/blog/what-programming-language-should-i-learn">here</a> to read more!</h3><br>
          <h3>The goal of this site is to ask you a few questions so that you can perhaps get a better idea of which language(s) you'd like to learn. To get started, please click the button below.
